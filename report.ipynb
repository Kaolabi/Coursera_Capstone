    "San Jose was founded on November 29, 1777, it is the  largest city in Northern California (both by population and area), with an estimated 2018 population of 1,030,119. \n",
    "\n",
    "San Jose Public Library is the largest public library system between San Francisco and Los Angeles. Its central library, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Library, is also the main library of the San Jose State University. As the result of a bond measure passed in November 2000, a number of new branches opened.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fremont is a city in Alameda County, California, United States. It is a young city incorporated on January 23, 1956. Located in the southeast San Francisco Bay Area and straddling both the East Bay and South Bay regions, Fremont has a rapidly-growing population of around 230,000. It is one of the largest cities by land area and the fourth most populous city in the San Francisco Bay Area, behind San Jose, San Francisco, and Oakland. The city has an extensive and rapidly expanding base of both tech industry and workers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fremont and San Jose are two popular cities in the Bay Area, northern California. These two cities are the first choices of young couples when considering to settle down. My objective is to compare the resources in two cities for young kids (less than 5 years). Daycare facility data and library data will be used as indicators to compare two cities."
